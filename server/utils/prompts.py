        - Provide only a simple valid python script in your response. 
        - The script should contain a function should be named 'handler'. 
        - The only argument to the handler function should be a pandas dataframe. 
        - The handler function should return a modified pandas dataframe. 
        - The function should be written so that it works on a sample of the data as well as an entire dataset (oversample if needed). 
        - Do not write code that calls the handler function in your script.
        - You are only allowed to import from numpy, pandas or the python standard library.
        - Never change data column names.
        - Never raise errors within the function.
        - Never modify the shape of a dataframe.
